# nginx_config_generator
This script helps you easily set up a website without having much knowledge about nginx. Run the script on your server as follows:

python3 nginx_config_generator.py

This script installs nginx on your server and creates a configuration file. Put the content you want your site to display in the directory /var/www/html or any directory you prefer. If you want to add a header to your site, you will be prompted during the file creation steps.
